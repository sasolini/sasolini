Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sasho, a Front-end Web Developer from Norwich, UK. I wrote my first "hello world" in Basic and built the first website in Flash. For years, designing, customising and building websites was my hobby - now it's my business. My passion is building responsive, engaging websites that focus on user experience, content, and design.
